Csound's [hrtfmove2](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/hrtfmove2.html) opcode(?) allows one to create binaural 3d effects.

The initial code inside
- takes a modified version of hrtfmove2's example csound file  (modified instruments and score)
- generates it in python
- runs it in python

The goal is to make it easier to generate a new score from python inputs.
